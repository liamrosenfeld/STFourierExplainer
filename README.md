# Short Time Fourier Explainer

My 2020 Swift Student Challenge entry

It guides you along the creation of multiple live views that all utilize the Short Time Fast Fourier Transform (STFFT) and its inverse. The goal of the playground is to guide the user along a path of learning in the fields of both programming and digital signal processing.

## Pages

1. Explains how a Short Time Fast Fourier Transform (STFFT) can be used to draw a spectrogram
2. Explains how the inverse can then be used to get the original signal back. It also introduces the overlap-add method, which is an approach to the inverse STFFT that dramatically increases the quality of the returned sample.
3. Combines the initial steps into a real world application. That application is using the STFFT to remove a high pitch squeal from a sound file. It ties both the forward and inverse STFFT from the previous pages.
4. Combines the live view of all the previous pages, giving a way to quickly experience the final product without the explanations.
